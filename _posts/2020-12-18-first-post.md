Today I want to talk about The Promised Neverland. 

**WARNING:** If you haven't watched it yet, this post will contain spoilers so go watch it first.

Anyways, as I was saying, I can't believe Norman was taken. There has to be a way that Norman is still alive. Maybe they haven't killed him yet because 
he needs to be fresh for The One. So he'll have a chance to escape. Plus, we need to figure out what he saw in that room. The only way we'll find out is from,
Mother, Norman or whoever was in the room if there was someone. I don't remeber if Mother even saw what was in the room or if she knows so that might cross
her off the list. Point is, Norman has to be alive.

Am I the only one who was shocked with the fact that Ray is Mother's son?

Also, Phil took the news suprisingly well in my opinion. He also seemed to have figured out that something was wrong already. Is he a genius?
